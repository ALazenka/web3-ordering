# web3 ordering

Use web3 to place orders at a restaurant - executed & stored on Ethereum.

This project is a spin-off from the [@_buildspace Ethereum & Solidity dApp build-along](https://buildspace.so/).

This project uses Solidity, Hardhat, Alchemy, and React to connect to a user's
wallet and transact against the blockchain.

The smart contract contained within this project stores a list of orders placed
at a restaurant. User's can add a new order that will increment the total count
and add it to the list of existing orders.
